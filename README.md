## Logic

 At the beginning of each game the computer generates a secret code of four colors. The colors are always chosen from the same six colors, no duplicates allowed.

 Your objective is to guess the secret code. You will have to guess the colors and put them in the same order as they are in the secret code.

 Choose four colors in the next available row. The computer will score your guess in the following way:

 For each guess that is right in both color and position you get a black point

 For each guess that is right in color but not in position you get a red point

 Good Luck!
