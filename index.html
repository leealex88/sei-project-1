      <p>At the beginning of each game the computer generates a secret code of four colors. The colors are always chosen from the same six colors, no duplicates allowed.</p>

<p>Your objective is to guess the secret code. You will have to guess the colors and put them in the same order as they are in the secret code.</p>

<p>Choose four colors in the next available row and then click on the Check button. The computer will score your guess in the following way:</p>

<p>For each guess that is right in both color and position you get a black point
For each guess that is right in color but not in position you get a red point<p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
